# Contribution Guidelines

We generally welcome any contributions to the project; in whatever form you can contribute.

## Ways to Contribute

### Communication

If you have specific feedback or ideas for the project, have a look at open discussions in the 
project "Issues" or create a new issue following the guidelines below how to create an issue.

You can also create feature wishes, which are then discussed and if approved will be converted
into feature tickets, which developers can then start implementing.

We're also looking for vulnerabilities. Please contract leading contributors directly (private 
message) if you discover any, as exposing them in the public issues would lead to more harm than
good.

### Submitting Code

You can either:

- submit code for bug fixes (highly appreciated), 
- contribute code to actively developed features or
- contribute tests or 
- DevOps code

For any main contributions, make sure to have an active feature ticket or bug tickey open,
that requests what you want to contribute.

We're following the general practice, where contributors (apart from the core contributors) fork
the repository they want to contribute to (this repository) into their private space, perform the 
code changes and then create a pull request in this repository. 

Pull requests should be linked to active bug or feature tickets or have to include sufficient 
information about the problem and the solution the pull request provides.

Pull requests get reviewed by core contributors and, if approved, your code changes will be merged
into this repostory.

## Issues (Creating and Contributing)

As a general note, please be nice to each other. No insults. Please also avoid discussions that do
not contribute to the project or problem in a ticket.

### Bug Tickets

If you find a defect (e.g. an element on the website doesn't behave as expected or doesn't work at 
all), please create a new issue and provide:

- **Context**: what are you trying to do, what did you do building up to the issue
- **Observed Behaviour**: describe the issue, providing sufficient information to replicate it, 
ideally attach screenshots of the problem.
- **Expected Behaviour**: describe the behaviour you expected to occur and how it deviates from the 
observed behaviour
- **System Information**: browser type and version, operating system, device type (mobile, tablet, pc),
timezone (in case of date / time related issues)

These are the essential elements a ticket has to contain. We reserve the right to close tickets 
outright, if they do not provide these essential elements.

Additionally it might be useful to provide:

- Any printouts from the browser console
- An overview of the network traffic in a tab

*Please avoid providing personal information in a ticket, as tickets are completely public*

### Feature Tickets

Feature tickets describe functionality that does not exist yet. If you want to propose a useful 
feature, please provide the following information:

- **Problem**: What problem does it solve? Provide context and details. Why is the problem worth solving?
- **Solution**: How do you envision the user interaction with the new feature? Which background processes
are required? Which extensions to the frontend would be required?
- **Constraints**: Provide any constraints you can think of. These could be other features that might be
affected by it or potential abuse of a solution, if not properly implemented.
- **Related Issues**: If you know of any related issues in this project, please link to them.
